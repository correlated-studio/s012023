<p>Time warps and twists the past as it marches relentlessly into the future. Emotions and experiences are often lost and blurred by the flow of time, fragmenting into entropy as they are replaced by new and blooming memories. However some memories remain steadfast and immune to this river; as fresh and bright as if they were lived yesterday.
    <br><br> 
    Time in Retrospect explores the relationship between memories and time, taking an introspective into how time can prune and alter our lived experience. Using the form of my installation as the manifestation of time, the object blurs and fragments memories from my childhood to present. Layered acetate sheets within the installation use the focal length of the projector to blur and distort footage from my past, distorting and defacing forgettable memories while more emotional and present memories remain crystal clear. In this way, I invite the onlooker to reflect upon their own memories and recognise how time has effected their perception of their past, whether that be similarly or differently to my own.
    <br><br> The past and the present are in a war of attrition, it is in our memories in which we discover who has won the small battles.
